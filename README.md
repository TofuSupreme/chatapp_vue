# Chat App

While experimenting with **Vue.js** and learning a bit about websockets, I came up with a simple chat app. The user (on the right hand side) can send a message to two different users within the chat app. This is an incomplete project. 

My next step is to create a log-in feature, clean up the styles, and add different usernames. 

## What I used:
**Vue.js, Socket.io, FontAwesome, JavaScript, HTML, CSS**
